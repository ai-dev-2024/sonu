# SONU Mobile App (v4+)

## Mobile Development Directory

**This directory is for mobile app development (Android/iOS).**

Only work here when explicitly requested to work on the mobile app. Desktop app development is in `../desktop/`.

## Structure

- `android/` - Android native code and Gradle project
- `ios/` - iOS native code (Swift/Objective-C)
- `whisper.cpp/` - Mobile whisper implementation

## Version

Current version: **4.0+** (Mobile)

Desktop app (v3.x) is in `../desktop/`.

## Notes

- This is a separate codebase from the desktop app
- Desktop and mobile do not share code (except possibly shared models/configs)
- Only work here when explicitly told to "work on mobile app"
