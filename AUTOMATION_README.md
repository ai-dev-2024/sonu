## 🔄 GitHub Integration

The script automatically:
1. Captures all screenshots and video
2. Adds them to git
3. Commits with timestamp
4. Pushes to GitHub

If Git credentials are not configured, it will show manual upload instructions.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can modify the script to:
- Add more tabs/features to capture
- Change screenshot resolution
- Adjust video recording settings
- Customize timing delays

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Playwright Not Found
```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Electron App Won't Launch
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check that `main.js` is in the root directory
- Verify Electron is installed: `npm list electron`

### Screenshots Not Capturing
- Check that the app window is visible
- Increase wait times in the script
- Verify selectors match your HTML structure

### Git Upload Fails
- Configure Git credentials:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- Or manually upload:
  ```bash
  git add screenshots recordings
  git commit -m "docs: Add screenshots and video"
  git push origin main
  ```

## 📝 Notes

- The script waits for the app to fully load before capturing
- Each screenshot includes a 1-2 second delay for animations
- Video recording captures the entire navigation sequence
- All files are timestamped for version tracking
