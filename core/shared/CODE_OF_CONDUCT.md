# Agent Collaboration Rules

1. **File Ownership**: Check `.agent-ownership` before editing
2. **Communication**: Update PROGRESS.md when milestones complete
3. **Git Workflow**: Each agent works on its own branch
4. **No Code Conflicts**: Desktop never touches mobile, mobile never touches desktop
5. **Shared Resources**: Models, docs, scripts go in `core/shared/` (read-only)
6. **Version Tags**: Desktop uses v3.x.x, Mobile uses v4.x.x
7. **Master Merge**: Only Architect merges branches into main
