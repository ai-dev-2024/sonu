# SONU Project Development Rules

## Default Development Environment

**By default, work on the DESKTOP app located in `apps/desktop/`**

- All file operations, code changes, and commands should target `apps/desktop/` unless explicitly told otherwise
- The desktop app is version 3.x (Electron-based)
- Working directory: `apps/desktop/`

## Mobile App Development

**Only switch to mobile when explicitly requested**

- When user says "work on mobile app" or "switch to mobile", change context to `apps/mobile/`
- Mobile app is version 4+ (Android/iOS native)
- Mobile and desktop are completely separate codebases

## File Organization

- **Active Desktop Files**: `apps/desktop/` - Use these for all desktop development
- **Active Mobile Files**: `apps/mobile/` - Use these only when working on mobile
- **Root Files**: Legacy/backup - Do NOT use for active development
- **Versions Folder**: Historical snapshots - Read-only, do not modify

## Important Rules

1. When editing files, check if they exist in both root and `apps/desktop/` - always use `apps/desktop/` version
2. When launching the app, always use `cd apps/desktop && npm start`
3. When searching for files, prioritize `apps/desktop/` over root-level files
4. If you find duplicate files (root vs apps/desktop), use the `apps/desktop/` version

## Context Awareness

- Default context: Desktop app (`apps/desktop/`)
- Mobile context: Only when explicitly requested
- Always verify you're working in the correct directory before making changes
